# Digital tickler ðŸ“…  âœ¨  ðŸ—‚

- Monitors a directory containing YYYY-MM-DD-files-or-folders
- Moves the files or folders to your inbox (e.g., the Desktop) when you start the computer.
- Can also use template directories to create and activate material on a regular basis.

# Think about

- Activate my flight-tickets for printing two days before the flight.
- Activate a PDF for the meeting on Tuesday.
- Activate project x in two weeks.
- Activate template y every Friday for a planning-and-review session (or Getting-Things-Done).
- Want to make decisions on new commitments not on an ad-hoc basis but when you think about the broader picture, i.e., in a weekly or monthly session? Just move them to the next weekly or monthly folder that is automatically created and activated.

# Features

- Cross-platform, tested on Ubuntu.
- Based on flat files, no additional database. Easy to backup and restore.
- Supports symlinks to avoid moving large files or folders (and triggering long sync-processes of Dropbox).
- Automatically creates and updates bookmarks in Nautilus (Linux) if regular template-directories are provided.

# Installation

```
pip install digital_tickler
```

# Setup

- Add tickler.py or start_tickler.sh to system-autostart.
- When the script is called for the first time:
  - Provide a tickler-path. This is a directory in which files or folders starting with YYYY-MM-DD- are stored. These files will be automatically moved to the inbox-path when the script is executed on YYYY-MM-DD (or any time after this date).
  - Provide an inbox-path. This is the directory to which the files and folders are transferred on YYYY-MM-DD. Choose a directory that you check regularly, such as the Desktop.
  - Optional: provide paths for template_weekly_path, template_monthly_path, template_semester_path, template_annual_path. The script will copy the template directories to the tickler-path on a regular basis, e.g., for regular review-and-planning sessions.
